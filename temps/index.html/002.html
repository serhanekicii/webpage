					<p>Short answer, this exists because it makes my life easier. Long answer; I believe this is the right place to publish and maintain projects, share work, art, knowledge, thoughts, and opinions with no censorship and with flexibility limited only to imagination. I am not a big fan of modern web advertisement, sharing private data, scrolling through social media feeds generated by typical algorithms, trackers, cookies, JavaScript... I don't admire to continue spinning this wheel either, let's break it with decentralization together! Check <a href="https://landchad.net">landchad.net</a> for more info.</p>

					<p>In my view, answering and explaining things individually is inefficient. If you have questions related to me personally, this is the best place to get answers. Check <a href="001-faq.html">F.A.Q.</a>.</p>
